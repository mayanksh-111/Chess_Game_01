# Chess_Game_01  
It is a fully functional, AI-integrated chess game built from scratch using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles. The game supports both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer (CPU) modes with Stockfish as the chess engine.

# Stockfish Setup Instructions  
To enable Player vs CPU mode using the Stockfish engine, follow these steps:

**1: Download Stockfish**  
Go to https://stockfishchess.org/download/ and download the appropriate version for your operating system.

**2: Place the Executable**  
After extracting the download, place the Stockfish executable file in the same directory as your chess program (e.g., next to chess.exe or chess).

**3: Set the Path in Code**  
Open **"chess.h"** and update the Stockfish path in the following function:
```
std::string getBestMoveFromStockfish(const std::string& fen, const std::string& stockfishPath = "stockfish.exe");
```
If the executable is not in the same folder, replace **"stockfish.exe"** with the full path to the Stockfish executable file.  

**4: Run the Game**  
Compile and run the game. Choose the "Player vs CPU" option to play against Stockfish.
